Achknowledgements
------------------
Significant parts of this code are based on modifications of other python packages. 
Specifically:

Badlands:
* this code makes use of many of the badlands classes.

Badlands-companion
* parts of the stratal mesh class and some of the vtk generation proccesses have been modified for efficiency or modified from jupyter notebooks.
* the badlands-companion tools provide an excellent example of how to interact with the badlands outputs and much of this code is a slighty simpler to use, duplication of that.

DoEgen (https://github.com/sebhaan/DoEgen)
* some of the code from the examples and api documentation.

DoEgen-Geo https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/DoEgen-Geo
* the example pipeline formed the basis for the integration of the DoEgen and DoEval tools with badlands. 
* The xml generator presented in the DoEgen-Geo example has been extended here is renamed as csv_to_badlands.

Similaritymeasures
* the wel similarity module implements code from the documnentation/examples.
